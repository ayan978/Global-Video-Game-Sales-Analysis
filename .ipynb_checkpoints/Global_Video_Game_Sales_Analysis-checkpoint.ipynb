    "# Reason for picking this dataset\n",
    "This dataset encompasses over 16,000 video game records, detailing attributes such as game name, platform, release year, genre, publisher, and sales figures across various regions (North America, Europe, Japan, Others) along with global sales. I chose this dataset because it provides diverse features that make it ideal for both supervised and unsupervised learning. "

    "### Sales Prediction Problem\n",
    " - Objective: Predict global sales using game features.\n",
    " - Key Question: Can we forecast a game's commercial success based on its genre, platform, and release year?\n",
    "### Market Segmentation Problem\n",
    " - Objective: Cluster games into meaningful commercial categories.\n",
    " - Key Question: Do games naturally group into distinct sales patterns?\n",
    "### Feature Importance Problem\n",
    " - Objective: Identify which attributes most influence sales.\n",
    " - Key Question: Which features (genre, platform, or region) are strongest predictors of commercial success?\n",
    "### Temporal Trend Problem\n",
    " - Objective: Analyze how sales patterns evolve across gaming eras.\n",
    " - Key Question: Have certain genres or platforms become more/less profitable over time?"
